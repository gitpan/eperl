  Changes between 2.2b2 and 2.2b3
  -------------------------------
  
  970521 o fixed NEWS and ANNOUNCE files o spellchecked 
           INSTALL, INSTALL.APACHE and eperl.pod
  970522 o fixed eperl.pod =back stuff and added a paragraph 
           about software leverage.
  970523 o added reference for Parse::ePerl and Apache::ePerl
           to eperl.pod
         o changed abstract in all source files
  970525 o ** added new option -P for an own #include preprocessor. **
         o added new option -I: same as for "perl" to
           add directories to @INC and preprocessor
  970526 o ** added support for URLs to #include **
         o added a kludge to etc/newvers for systems
           like BSDI where no "getopt" program is available
  970527 o added Parse::ePerl::Preprocess which is the
           interface to the new preprocessor
         o added six new environment variables:
           SCRIPT_SRC_PATH, SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_DIR and SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_FILE
           SCRIPT_SRC_URL, SCRIPT_SRC_URL_DIR and SCRIPT_SRC_URL_FILE
         o fixed a long-standing bug: temporary files were 
           not removed :-(
         o added new option -C for HTML entity conversions 
           inside ePerl blocks. This is for people who
           use HTML editors which have now knowledge of ePerl code.
  970529 o slightly fixed eperl.pod at some places

  Changes between 2.2b1 and 2.2b2
  -------------------------------

  970518 o fixed ``make install UNINST=1'' case
           for Makefile.PL
  970520 o added more POD to Apache::ePerl

  Changes between 2.2a2 and 2.2b1
  -------------------------------

  970505 o again reorganized the source
           code and renamed a lot of
           functions.
         o created modules/ with h2xs
           for a Parse::ePerl module
         o created generation of libeperl.a
           containing shared objects for
           Parse::ePerl
  970506 o created a top-level Makefile.PL
           for faking a MakeMaker distribution
  970509 o created a Apache::ePerl module
  970510 o added option -i for making the
           delimiters case-sensitive in more
           explicit way
  970511 o added t/05* to Parse::ePerl
           and made delimiter case variable
  970513 o enhanced Parse::ePerl and 
           finished Apache::ePerl
  970515 o fixed tests 4 and 5 for non-Bash users
           and fixed a char/int problem in eperl_main.c
           and eperl_sys.c
           [Thanks to Jarom Smith <jarom@jarom-indy.prophet.com>]
  970516 o finished Apache::ePerl and Parse::ePerl
  970517 o added a INSTALL.APACHE which describes the
           installation of ePerl as an SSSL under Apache

  Changes between 2.2a1 and 2.2a2
  -------------------------------

  970504 o removed -s and added -m 755 
           to install in configure
         o optimized the parser; no 
           ``print "";'' constructs are
           never created which at least slightly 
           speeds up processing.

  Changes between 2.2a0 and 2.2a1
  -------------------------------

  970503 o now the begin and end delimiters are searched
           case-insensitive.
         o added -h for displaying the usage list.
           Just to be consequent with options.
         o added leading and trailing whitespaces
           for Perl blocks when translating the source file
           to make the -x display more readable.

  Changes between 2.1.1 and 2.2a0
  -------------------------------

  970502 o added support for '=' prefix: now <:= ... :>
           automatically gets converted to "print ...".  Now one
           can interpolate variables in a more shorter way via
           <?=$variable!> instead of the long <?  print
           $variable; !> (in conjunction with the next
           enhancements)
         o now ePerl is much smarter when converting the ePerl
           blocks, i.e. it now recognizes final semicolons and
           automatically puts one if missing. Now <: cmd;cmd :>
           is also valid.
         o Whitespaces are not only stripped
           from the beginning of a ePerl block. Now
           they are stripped from the end, too.
         o !!CHANGED THE PARSING AGAIN!!
           Now again (as in 2.0.3) ePerl block end delimiters are
           found via plain forward search. No quoted strings are
           recognized.  The reason is that constructs with odd
           number of quoting characters are more often seen than
           end delimiters in quoted string. And one more fact: It
           is easier to escape the end delimiter in a quotes
           string (e.g.  via backslahes) than to rewrite a
           complex construct (e.g.  m|"[^"]+"| !!).
         o added -T (Tainting) and -w (Warnings) options
           which can be used like the same in "perl".
         o added alpha and snap releases to NEWVERS

  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 2.1.0 and 2.1.1
  -------------------------------
   
  970501 o added -P option to etc/newsvers
         o removed \n at SCRIPT_.._CTIME
  970502 o replaced the $| = 1 stuff in eperl_perl5.c to the way
           mod_perl does it 
           [Thanks to Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org> for patch]
         o enhanced the SetUID-based UID/GID checking: now in
           eperl_global.h is an option DO_ON_FAILED_STEP which
           either forces ePerl to error on any failed checks or go
           on but finally don't do the UID/GID switching
         o moved the security definitions from eperl_global.h to
           a new eperl_security.h and changed the references in
           eperl.pod

  Changes between 2.1b8 and 2.1.0
  -------------------------------

  970426 o removed more obsolete @logfile@ stuff
         o again revised eperl.pod
         o !! CHANGED LICENSE !!
           NOW ePerl IS DISTRIBUTED AT THE TERMS
           OF EITHER THE GPL OR THE ARTISTIC LICENSE
           LIKE THE Perl 5.0 INTERPRETER ITSELF
         o fixed /tmp/x usage in configure
         o created PORTING file
         o tested ePerl on various platforms
         o made seteuid/setegid configureable
           via GNU autoconf for HP/UX and others
         o made the include files in eperl_globa.h
           conditional
         o made the -O2 conditional for GCC only

  Changes between 2.1b7 and 2.1b8
  -------------------------------

  970425 o fixed installation manpath
         o fixed a security hole: the
           effective uid/gid have to be eliminated
           independend of mode and uid switching
         o fixed some typos in eperl.pod
         o rewritten the NEWS file
         o renamed the options:
           -D => -d, -E => -D (more intuitive)
           -b => -B, -e => -E (prevent conflicts)
         o fixed the order of command line
           option descriptions
         o removed the @logfile@ stuff from Makefile

  Changes between 2.1b6 and 2.1b7
  -------------------------------

  970425 o fixed error page colors
         o changed some aux files: NEWS, TODO
         o added .cgi to allowed extensions
           for using shebang CGI/ePerl scripts 
         o added more clear info about shebang
           to eperl.pod
         o fixed more bugs in eperl.pod
         o removed the exit on debug
         o finished the test suite
         o slightly fixed the usage output
         o added support for HEAD requests in
           case the server does not do it for us
         o documented provided env variables
         o created new isotime() function
           for SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED_ISOTIME variable
         o removed eperl_log.c because this 
           will be used in later versions only

  Changes between 2.1b5 and 2.1b6
  -------------------------------

  970414 o slightly changed the error message page
  970418 o created -c for syntax check like "perl -c"
         o now the default delimiters are
                <? .. !> for CGI modes
           and  <: ...:> for Filter mode
         o removed the delimiters defs in eperl_global.h
           but added a table to eperl.pod
         o completely rewritten the setuid security stuff !!
         o added security information to eperl.pod
         o now -x does something useful: it outputs
           the internally generated Perl script to /dev/tty
           and exits

  Changes between 2.1b4 and 2.1b5
  -------------------------------

  970404 o now when used as a Unix filter the exit code 
           is != 0 on error while for CGI scripts it is
           still 0 (needed to make the webserver happy 
           and to force him to accept your HTML error page).
         o now prints the error message on stderr instead
           of stdout in Unix filter mode
         o fixed "make distclean", now t/Makefile is 
           also removed.

  Changes between 2.1b3 and 2.1b4
  -------------------------------

  970403 o fixed a bug in the b3 distribution:
           autoheader was not run, so to _compile_
           ePerl GNU autoconf was needed. :-(
         o slight adjustments to eperl.pod

  Changes between 2.1b2 and 2.1b3
  -------------------------------

  970402 o starting with Perl 5.003_96 the dXSUB_SYS define
           is empty.  Removed the call and the gcc -Wall 
           kludge from eperl_perl5.c
         o fixed etc/newvers
         o add "none" to configure DynaLoader check

  Changes between 2.1b1 and 2.1b2
  -------------------------------
  
  970330 o reduced the logo GIF image in size to fit betteri
           into the browser window. The reduced one also has 
           10 KB less bytes.
         o made the Error HTML page nicer
         o removed the not used -a (age) option

  Changes between 2.1b0 and 2.1b1
  -------------------------------

  970326 o added "-o file" to the usage message
         o when running as a Unix filter the current
           working directory is restored before the
           final outputfile (-o) is created.
         o documented that "-o outputfile" is
           relative to source file dir when
           runtime mode is CGI or NPH-CGI
         o added new-betalevel to Makefile.in

  Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1b0
  -------------------------------

  970322 o released as 2.1b0 for first test

  970310 o added --with-perl=/path/to/perl option
           to ./configure to force a specific perl

  970302 o removed getdate.c stuff :-(
         o added more tests
         o changed aux dir to etc for porting to WinNT :-(

  970228 o debugged and cleanup up eperl_parse.c
         o fixed the core-dump under SunOS which
           comes from SunOS' non-POSIX vsprintf().
         o removed the sdbm and md5 stuff because
           this should be introduced in 3.0 later only.
         o removed brainfile stuff
         o fixed another coredump in eperl_parse.c
         o fixed mode determination and mode-dependend
           error message

  970227 o debugged and cleanup up eperl_parse.c

  970226 o added dmalloc support for debugging

  970224 o changed sprintf stuff to more portable 
           variant in eperl_main.c
         o now autoconf checks for memmove and
           if not found eperl_parse.c uses bcopy.

  970219 o changed bool checking to Autoconf stuff

  970216 o ported to Linux: now bool is defined,
           prefix was replaced by AC_prefix to avoid collisions and the
           ccdlflags from Perl are used which need to be -rdynamic under
           Linux. Now ePerl compiles out of the box on Linux and runs fine,
           even with dynamic loading.

  970210 o added getdate() code
         o added --enable-brainfile=/path/to/brainfile
           which sets the brain file where timestamps and
           md5 etc. are stored.
         o added -a option to set an age

  970209 o added MD5 code
         o added SDBM code

  970207 o changed -c and -s options to -m c and -m f
         o adding -m n for NPH/CGI, -m c is no only CGI
         o added stdin support via "-" and tmpfiles
         o added automatic tmpfile support with remove
           on interrupts or errors
         o now the old tempfiles are also created
           with new mechanism
         o added -o option for specifying an
           explicit outputfile instead of stdout
         o greatly imporved the manpage and brroght it 
           to the latest status
         o created a test suite with Perl Test::Harness
         o now ePerl also accepts an empty file
         o added a security logfile which can be optionally
           enabled via "--enable-logfile=/path/to/logfile"
           at compile time.
         o added configure support for debug compilation
           via --enable-debug. This adds -g -ggdb3 to
           the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS and prevents the
           executable from being stripped.
         o removed the old doc/ subdir with the
           old FAQ and About file. 

  970206 o removed the generation of libeperl.a
         o added a real installation target to Makefile
         o removed eperl_parse.h, because it is still
           replaced by the generated eperl_proto.h
         o added -V option which now displays the compile
           parameters
         o removed the <tt>..</tt> tags from error output
           because for the stand-alone version is looks bad.
         o added experimental TAINT...TAINT_NOT around perl_run.
         o added -d option to set real Perl variables and
           not just $ENV{'...'};

  970128 o added support to configure for Perl snapshot
           releases named 5.003_XX.
         o added a first security check: If operating in
           NPH-CGI mode the source file has to be one of
           the predefined valid file extensions.
         o now when ePerl runs as a setuid program (seteuid = 0)
           it switches to the uid/gid of the file owner 

  970127 o added -D option to set environment variables.
           (this is needed for my WML project where in
           pass 3 eperl gets called via -D...)
         o added -k option to keep CWD.
           (this is needed for my WML project where 
           ePerl should not chdir to the /tmp/xxx files).

  970118 o make the BEGIN/END_DELIMITER strings variables which
           now can be set via -b and -e 
           (this is needed for my WML project where I use
           two variants of embedded Perl blocks)

  970107 o fixed this changelog file
         o added test directory
         o cleanup of Makefile
         o removed obsolete prototypes in eperl_lib.h
         o cleaned up eperl_global.h
         o make eperl_getopt.[ch] gcc -Wall clean
         o added support for shebang usage, i.e.  you can use #!/path/to/eperl
           at the top of your pages and use them as a CGI script now. ePerl
           will ignore the shebang line.
         o moved the system IO and env functions out to new eperl_sys.c
         o renamed eperl_lib to eperl_parse
         o Hups! all references to the CGI/1.0 standard were wrong, it
           actually is CGI/1.1...

  970106 o added stand-alone interpreter with options
         o added -x and -v options
         o added README and LICENSE display
         o now ePerl reads the file from stdin if
           the argument is "-"
         o added a ePerl manual page for the
           stand-alone interpreter

  ___________________________________________________________________________


  Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3
  -------------------------------

  970104 o added some documentation from the webpages to misc/doc/
         o added a FreeBSD ports area to the webpages

  Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2
  -------------------------------

  970104 o remove of the temporary files were disabled for
           debugging purposes. Fixed.

  Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1
  -------------------------------

  970103 o removed unused variables

  Changes between 1.0 and 2.0.0
  -----------------------------

  970102 o ePerl now supports the Perl 5 DynaLoader interface for
           dynamic linking and loading of shared modules. This provides ePerl
           with the complete power of the underlying Perl 5 installation,
           including the shared objects.

         o ePerl now runs as NPH-CGI/1.1 script, i.e. as a Non-Parsed-Header
           CGI-script. This means that it is able to create its own HTTP
           header.  Implications of this include:
             - To create HTTP headers just put them on the first
               lines in your script as plain text or just generate them on the
               fly by a ePerl block at the beginning of your script. With this
               feature you can for instance write pages which create images
               instead of HTML code.
             - If no headers were created by the script, it
               outputs it with MIME-type "text/html", including an additional
               calculated "Content-Length" header.
             - It automatically adds "Date" and "Server" headers.
  
         o ePerl now saves and checks the STDERR output of the script.
           If this contains data this implies an error and leads to the
           display of the error HTML page, displaying the STDERR output.
  
         o ePerl now saves the STDOUT output of the script (the real
           contents). This implies that it can calculate the Content-Length or
           ignore it if STDERR was created and the error page have to be
           displayed.
  
         o Additional environment variables will be set by ePerl
           prior to the execution of the bristled Perl blocks:
             SCRIPT_SRC_SIZE ....... the byte size of the original source file
             SCRIPT_SRC_MTIME ...... the integer value of the last modify time
             SCRIPT_SRC_MTIME_FMT .. the formatted string of the last modify time
             SCRIPT_SRC_OWNER ...... the owner of the original source file
             VERSION_INTERPRETER ... the ePerl version string
             VERSION_LANGUAGE ...... the Perl version string
  
         o The ePerl sources were split into distinct peaces to
           allow further development, e.g. a standalone program or a Apache
           API module.

  ___________________________________________________________________________


  Changes between 1.4 and 1.5
  ---------------------------

  9609xx o started with the work to split the ePerl
           functionality into a library and create a stand-alone
           CGI-program and a Apache module which use this library.

  Changes between 1.3 and 1.4
  ---------------------------

  960906 o changed source from PATH_INFO to PATH_TRANSLATED

         o cleanup the sources and released it
           the first time officially on the Web

  Changes between 1.2 and 1.3
  ---------------------------

  960622 o created WWW pages

         o changed all old EPL references to ePerl

         o added a lot of comments to the source

         o made the begin and end delimiters variable

         o changed the end delimiter from ">" to "!>"
           because ">" makes problems if it occurs inside the 
           ePerl block

  Changes between 1.1 and 1.2
  ---------------------------

  960510 o created GNU autoconf files, Makefiles, etc.

  Changes between 1.0 and 1.1
  ---------------------------

  960415 o fixed a bug in the escape code: more chars 
           have to be escaped!

  Changes between *GENESIS* and 1.0
  ---------------------------------

  960323 o adapted for Apache 1.1b0+ak

  960310 o *GENESIS*
