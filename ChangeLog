  Changes between 2.2.11 and 2.2.12
  ---------------------------------
  [Bugfix only]

  971231 o ARGL! We really need 1998 now: Yesterday
           I've released 2.2.11 with two nasty syntax errors in
           the configure script. Hmmmmm... 1998 is now really
           needed, I think.  [Thanks to Anthony Fok
           <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> and ??? <djk@tobit.co.uk>
           for quick response and patch]

  Changes between 2.2.10 and 2.2.11
  ---------------------------------
  [Bugfix only]

  971230 o Activated Perl Locale support for both Perl 5.003 
           and Perl 5.004 variants.
         o Fixed owner determination in eperl_main.c: ePerl core
           dumped when the owner of the script does not exists in
           the passwd database.
         o Updated contrib/pkg/ files
         o Updated VERSIONS file

  Changes between 2.2.9 and 2.2.10
  --------------------------------
  [Bugfix only]

  971228 o little distribution bug: the asc2c was not run before
           the 2.2.9 release, so it has to be run by the builder
           which is not what was intended.

  Changes between 2.2.8 and 2.2.9
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix only]

  971120 o fixed demo.image.phtml description
  971221 o fixed a really nasty fclose() bug in eperl_main.c
           which caused core dumps under Debian GNU/Linux with
           libc6.  [Thanks to <tv@havoc.fi> and Anthony Fok
           <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> for hints]

  Changes between 2.2.7 and 2.2.8
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Minor Enhancement]

  971107 o ported to AIX 4.1.x by adding a fix for Perl's ccdlflags
  971108 o again made Apache::ePerl even more complete: added the
           following env variables similar to nph-eperl:
           SCRIPT_SRC_URL, SCRIPT_SRC_URL_DIR,
           SCRIPT_SRC_URL_FILE, SCRIPT_SRC_PATH,
           SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_DIR, SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_FILE,
           SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED, SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED_CTIME,
           SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED_ISOTIME, SCRIPT_SRC_SIZE,
           SCRIPT_SRC_OWNER
         o enhanced the Apache::ePerl status page: now displays
           also the cache size
  971116 o fixed shebang mode for webserver environment.  [Thanks
           to J. Douglas Dunlop <dunlop@ionline.net> for hint]
         o added hint to INSTALL file that PerlIO+SfIO is currently
           not supported.
         o fixed HTTP header parsing: now setting of cookies
           (e.g.  via Perl's CGI module) work correctly.
         o fixed HTTP header parsing in Apache::ePerl. Now even
           the special-case "Content-type: ..." works as expected. 
  971117 o fixed typos in eperl.pod
         o fixed preprocessing for Apache::ePerl
         o overhauled the demo webpages under eg/. Now the
           CGI::Cookie is used an example for CGI.pm.
         o adjusted VERSIONS file

  Changes between 2.2.6 and 2.2.7
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Minor Enhancement]

  971102 o reduced memory consumption of Apache::ePerl by
           specificing detailed import flags
         o fixed prototype bug in Parse::ePerl's XS part
           [Thanks to Doug MacEachern <dougm@opengroup.org> for patch]
         o removed the not needed AUTOLOAD facility from
           Parse::ePerl because this causes problems.
           [Thanks to Doug MacEachern <dougm@opengroup.org> for hint]
  971104 o added VERSION_LANGUAGE and VERSION_INTERPRETER
           environment variables to Apache::ePerl the same way it is provides
           by the stand-alone program.
  971105 o adjusted the URL to the Perl homepage in the PODs.
         o fixed Content-length header generation in Apache::ePerl
         o minor cleanup to Parse::ePerl
  971106 o added workarounds to Parse::ePerl for tainted environments 
           like the "PerlTaintCheck On" under Apache/mod_perl where
           Parse::ePerl is called from Apache::ePerl.
         o made the Apache::ePerl error page similar to the one nph-eperl
           displays.

  Changes between 2.2.5 and 2.2.6
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Minor Enhancement]

  970903 o merged ANNOUNCE and ANNOUNCE.ADDR files
         o slightly fixed comments in eperl_getopt.[ch]
  970911 o added mod/README with CPAN module snipppet
         o changed the $VERSION variables to hold a real floating
           point number like 2.0206 instead of 2.2.6
         o updated contrib/pkg/fbsdpkg/ stuff
         o fixed a bug in the preprocessor: filedescriptors were
           not closed for #include directive [Thanks to
           mhalperi@bbnplanet.com for patch]
  971024 o fixed configure's Perl version check because of Perl
           5.004_04's changed -v output.
         o added Apache->request($r) to Apache::ePerl for
           Apache::Registry modules like new CGI.pm under mod_perl-1.02.
         o updated PORTING file
         o added GNU long options
         o changed -i (nocase on delimiters) to -n
         o cleaned up source by sorted options
         o now the usage is only displayed on -h/--help
         o now the copyright and disclaimer is displayed on -V, too.
         o now configure removes -D_POSIX_SOURCE from Perl's
           ccflags under IRIX 5.3 because this causes problems with strdup.
         o now configure explicitly removed newlines at the end
           of the determined hostname/domainname pair because these
           would lead to a failure for GNU autoconfs final sed-part.
           [Thanks to <paul@miraclefish.com> for bug report]
         o added another -f test inside configure when trying 
           to find a perl binary because when /tmp/perl is
           a directory -x alone fails.
         o added eperl_config.[ch] and moved some code from
           eperl_global to this file.
         o added test for strdup() to configure and a private 
           replacement version to eperl_config.c (from FreeBSD 2.2)
           because Ultrix is missing strdup().
           [Thanks to Joerg Lenneis <lenneis@wu-wien.ac.at> for hint]
         o now the XS-Init function in eperl_perl5.c has a variable
           list of newXS() calls which come from the new
           eperl_perl5_sm.h file which itself is generated by
           eperl_perl5_sm.pl. This way we're now really able to
           use static module when no DynaLoader is available.
           [Thanks to Joerg Lenneis <lenneis@wu-wien.ac.at> for hint]
  971027 o fixed also PORTING.test for new "perl -v" output
         o changed "prefix" stuff in Makefile.in to make the
           life of our Debian friends a little bit easier... ;_)
         o added Debian stuff to contrib/pkg/dpkg/
         o added workaround in aclocal.m4 for SunOS's braindead "date"
         o sucessfully run PORTING.test on platforms found in PORTING

  Changes between 2.2.4 and 2.2.5
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Minor Enhancement]

  970902 o fixed error catching for Parse::ePerl::Precompile.
           [Thanks to Joseph W. Norton <norton@alum.mit.edu> for hint]
  970903 o added better support for PerlIO/StdIO. The combination
           PerlIO/SfIO is currently untested and may be broken because
           the I/O redirection for SfIO is very different from StdIO.
         o added Perl I/O layer info to eperl -V
         o added built time/user info to configure and eperl -V

  Changes between 2.2.3 and 2.2.4
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Major Enhancement]

  970901 o added more hints to PORTING file
         o fixed a bug in Parse::ePerl for case where $error was undefined
           [Thanks to Joseph W. Norton <norton@alum.mit.edu> for patch]
         o fixed -I option: now it works as expected even for
           cases where you want to add stuff to @INC which is
           needed at _parse_ time.
         o now the webmaster can configure the delimiters and other stuff via
           Apache::ePerl::Config hash from within <Perl>...</Perl> sections in
           Apache. An example is added to the synopsis of Apache::ePerl
           manpage.

  Changes between 2.2.2 and 2.2.3
  -------------------------------
  [Security Bugfix and Minor Enhancement]

  970821 o fixed installation section in Apache::ePerl manpage
         o ***** SECURITY BUGFIX *****
           ePerl versions <= 2.2.2 have a heavy security hole when running
           under a webserver's CGI/1.1 interface.   Because ePerl assumed here
           there are not command line arguments. THIS IS WRONG! According to
           the CGI/1.1 spec when an ISINDEX document is used (QUERY_STRING!)
           the query is provided on the command line by the webserver.  So,
           when only one query existed, there was exactly one command line
           argument and ePerl switched to stand-alone runtime mode and all
           CGI-mode restrictions are falling down!!
           ***** SECURITY BUGFIX *****
           [Thanks to Andrew Pimlott <pimlott@abel.MATH.HARVARD.EDU> for
           finding this security bug!]
         o now a chdir is done before the preprocessor is run so relative
           paths in #include directives work as expected.  [Thanks to Marc
           Singer <elf@netcom.com> for patch]

  Changes between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Porting Enhancement]

  970804 o removed bad demo.errsync.phtml 
  970806 o fixed a few spaces in Makefile.in
  970807 o removed wrong $AUTOLOAD from Apache::ePerl 
         o fixed a few other things in Apache::ePerl and Parse::ePerl
         o added 2.2.1 to VERSIONS file
         o moved the place of the release macros in Makefile.in
           before any targets because some braindead Make variants
           don't like it in the middle of targets.
         o added a new test 09-dynaloader.t for testing if
           dynamic loading works correctly.
         o added error capturing for Parse::ePerl::Evaluate via __DIE__ hook.
         o fixed the PODs
         o moved -lperl at linking after DynaLoader
  970808 o fixed configure help string for --with-perl=PATH
         o added missing .eperl extension in eperl_security.h
           [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann <heiko@os.inf.tu-dresden.de> for hint]
         o added more stuff to INSTALL.APACHE
  970811 o fixed wrong coding in setuid check
           [Thanks to SONE Takeshi <ts1@tsn.or.jp> for patch]

  Changes between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix and Enhancement]

  970721 o fixed eg/demo.net.phtml
  970727 o optimized the Perl 5 internal stuff in eperl_eperl5.c 
           [Thanks to Doug McEachern <dougm@opengroup.org> for patches]
         o added support for Cwd parameter to Parse::ePerl::Precompile and use
           this also in Apache::ePerl when precompiling.  
           [Thanks to Michael Lazar <michael@vertex.worldweb.com> for idea]
         o added support for quotation marks and angle brackets in #include
           and #sinclude directives: these are just skipped.
           [Thanks to Karl Wallner <karl.wallner@x3network.net> for idea]
         o now DOCUMENT_ROOT is automatically added to @INC in CGI modes.
           [Thanks to Karl Wallner <karl.wallner@x3network.net> for idea]
         o now Apache::ePerl always uses option "ConvertEntities=1" when
           calling Parse::ePerl::Translate.
           [Thanks to Mike Pheasant <pheasant@gte.net> for hint]
         o fixed demos for strict variables and added both .phtml
           and .iphtml files (same contents!) for easier testing
           with both nph-eperl and Apache::ePerl.
         o added support for generated custom HTTP headers
           to Apache::ePerl.
  970801 o added "/eperl" to $libdir for installation
         o now "make install" installs the demo pages into $libdir/eg
         o added PORTING.test script for making porting tests easier
         o changed test for Perl in configure from "test -f" to "test -x"
         o fixed the examples again.
         o fixed a few things in eperl.pod
  970802 o enhanced the overwriting of the perl and cc programs
           for the build process. See INSTALL for more details.
         o enhanced PORTING.test to be able to set perl and cc.
         o added overview to INSTALL

  Changes between 2.2b9 and 2.2.0
  -------------------------------
  [Bugfix only]

  970706 o added missing eperl_getopt.h include
           for eperl_main.c which caused the compilation
           at least under SunOS 4.x to fail.
         o added more descriptive error message
           to configure when Perl version is to old
         o added hint to INSTALL that the same
           environment have to be used for compiling
           ePerl as for Perl.
  970709 o added klduge to support Perl+SFIO where
           fwrite has to be replaced by PerlIO_write
         o enabled ``CC=/path/to/cc ./configure'' again
           for cases where one wants to overwrite the
           used C compiler.
  970714 o removed some unused defines in eperl_global.h
           which lead to problems under AIX 4.1.4
         o removed the P_ macros in eperl_proto.h because
           AIX 4.1.4 is not happy about it because of
           PrintError defines which has "...". Should
           be ok without P_ because we need an ANSI
           compiler since the first days.
  970715 o changed Perl requirement from 5.00390 to 5.00325
  970718 o added ANNOUNCE.ADDR file
         o updated NEWS file and updated ANNOUNCE file
         o updated VERSIONS file
         o slightly adjusted NEWS file
         o created contrib/utils/00README file
         o added the package files to contrib/pkg/
         o updated the demo files

  Changes between 2.2b8 and 2.2b9
  -------------------------------

  970623 o added docs about #elsif to eperl.pod and NEWS file
  970628 o added VERSIONS file with ePerl history
         o shit happens: the preprocessor parsing had
           nasty bugs where a string "#include" somewhere
           in the text leads to a total skip of all
           real "^#include" directives :-(

  Changes between 2.2b7 and 2.2b8
  -------------------------------

  970615 o added hint about Options +ExecCGI
           to mod/Apache/ePerl.pm
         o split the ChangeLog file into seperated files
         o added old stuff from 2.1.2 to end of NEWS file
         o created a KNOWN.BUGS file
         o created a INSTALL.NSAPI
         o slightly fixed the POD in mod/Apache/ePerl.pm
         o created a new set of demo files in eg/
         o fixed some README headers
  970620 o created a contrib/ dir and initially
           started to write a shtml2phtml script
           which converts (X)SSI to ePerl
         o fixed tabs in top-level Makefile
  970622 o changed red colors to blue ones in error page
         o added the new powered-by-ePerl image
           which can be retrieved via URL nph-eperl/powered.gif
         o added del2del script to contrib/
         o added a #elsif to the preprocessor

  Changes between 2.2b6 and 2.2b7
  -------------------------------

  970602 o now etc/newvers always removes /tmp/genopt 
           [Thanks to Phil Ritzenthaler <phil@cgrg.ohio-state.edu>
            for hint]
         o now configure determines the full 
           operating system id from Perl's Config.pm
  970604 o set -Wl,-woff 85 only for IRIX 6.x because
           IRIX 5.x hates this option..
           [Thanks to Ewan McPhail <ewan@epages.iafrica.com> and
            Phil Ritzenthaler <phil@cgrg.ohio-state.edu> for hint]
         o fixed the preprocessor: the inital searching
           of the directives was broken, only worked
           when a specific order was used. So some
           directives were skipped :-(
         o added a #sinclude (secure include) directive
           which is the same as #include but removes
           all begin and end delimiters, so this one
           is a secure way of including stuff from 
           foreign servers.
         o rewritten the preprocessor part of eperl.pod

  Changes between 2.2b5 and 2.2b6
  -------------------------------

  970601 o added a #c preprocessor directive
           to be able to comment out stuff
           (even to use "#c #include..." to
           disable an include directive)
           [Thanks to J. Douglas Dunlop for hint]
         o now the preprocessor checks the
           HTTP response code when http://..
           is uses as the file:
           - when 301 and 302 are returned
             it searches for the new URL in the Location-header 
             and restarts with this one
           - when a response code other
             than 200 (OK) is returned it fails the same way 
             as it fails when a local file it not found: 
             with an error.
           [Thanks to J. Douglas Dunlop for hint]
         o removed the Bash check in configure
           because this it not used 

  Changes between 2.2b4 and 2.2b5
  -------------------------------

  970530 o fixed perlvers -> perl_vers stuff
         o fixed again problem with VERSION stuff:
           ePerl.pm's were broken (ARGL!)

  Changes between 2.2b3 and 2.2b4
  -------------------------------

  970529 o fixed preprocessor: #include only
           valid at column 0, i.e. at start of line
         o added a test 08 for the preprocessor
         o now any characters are skipped at end 
           of #include lines up to the newline
         o added new parsing feature:
           "_" as the last non-whitespace command disables the automatic
           adding of the final semicolon. This is to be able to writeo
           <: if { :> ... <: } :> etc.
         o added new optional(!) parsing feature
           which is per-default disabled(!): "\" directly before a newline
           character outside ePerl blocks prevent the newline to be printed,
           i.e. the line is continued in the output
           This feature can be turned on via new option -L.
         o added new parsing feature: 
           when an end delimiter is directly followed by ``//''
           this discards all data up to and including the following
           newline.
         o added three new commands to preprocessor
           which gets converted to ePerl blocks:
           ``#if expr'' -> ``<: if (expr) { _:>//'
           ``#else''    -> ``<: } else { _:>//''
           ``#endif''   -> ``<: } _:>//''
         o imported the patch from ePerl 2.1.2 which
           fixes a problem under non-GCC compilers
           with a semicolon in eperl_security.h
         o removed the sin_len stuff
  970530 o !! Essential Change !!
           configure now imports all essential compilation
           flags from Perl's Config.pm, including the compiler.
           This is necessary to make ePerl work even under
           HP-UX and IRIX where they need the special compiler
           and special compiler flags. The point is that
           Perl already determined the correct flags, so
           we can use it.
         o changed C++ style comments in
           eperl_parse.c to C style
         o fixed a missing "int" in eperl_sys.c 
         o renamed eperl_getopt.c to original
           eperl_egetopt.c and make the namespace
           clean, i.e. renamed optXXX to egetopt_optXXX.
           This is needed at least for IRIX
         o changes egetopt() slightly
         o replaced the old egetopt() by the GNU getopt()
           because egetopt() was broken under some
           systems like IRIX.
         o option -h now never displays the version
         o added a missing semicolon in mod/Parse/ePerl.pm
         o renamed and fixed mod/Parse/t/04_compile.t 
         o now etc/newvers resets the LANG variable
           to prevent LOCALE warnings
         o provided an own copy of perl_eval_pv() which
           is too new. It was introduced in Perl 5.003_97e.
           Now plain old Perl 5.003 will work again.
         o the Perl 5 interface modules can only be
           used with Perl 5.003_90 or higher because
           of the TIEHANDLE stuff which is not working
           in prior releases.
         o fixed update-version target in Makefile.i

  Changes between 2.2b2 and 2.2b3
  -------------------------------
  
  970521 o fixed NEWS and ANNOUNCE files o spellchecked 
           INSTALL, INSTALL.APACHE and eperl.pod
  970522 o fixed eperl.pod =back stuff and added a paragraph 
           about software leverage.
  970523 o added reference for Parse::ePerl and Apache::ePerl
           to eperl.pod
         o changed abstract in all source files
  970525 o ** added new option -P for an own #include preprocessor. **
         o added new option -I: same as for "perl" to
           add directories to @INC and preprocessor
  970526 o ** added support for URLs to #include **
         o added a kludge to etc/newvers for systems
           like BSDI where no "getopt" program is available
  970527 o added Parse::ePerl::Preprocess which is the
           interface to the new preprocessor
         o added six new environment variables:
           SCRIPT_SRC_PATH, SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_DIR and SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_FILE
           SCRIPT_SRC_URL, SCRIPT_SRC_URL_DIR and SCRIPT_SRC_URL_FILE
         o fixed a long-standing bug: temporary files were 
           not removed :-(
         o added new option -C for HTML entity conversions 
           inside ePerl blocks. This is for people who
           use HTML editors which have now knowledge of ePerl code.
  970529 o slightly fixed eperl.pod at some places

  Changes between 2.2b1 and 2.2b2
  -------------------------------

  970518 o fixed ``make install UNINST=1'' case
           for Makefile.PL
  970520 o added more POD to Apache::ePerl

  Changes between 2.2a2 and 2.2b1
  -------------------------------

  970505 o again reorganized the source
           code and renamed a lot of
           functions.
         o created modules/ with h2xs
           for a Parse::ePerl module
         o created generation of libeperl.a
           containing shared objects for
           Parse::ePerl
  970506 o created a top-level Makefile.PL
           for faking a MakeMaker distribution
  970509 o created a Apache::ePerl module
  970510 o added option -i for making the
           delimiters case-sensitive in more
           explicit way
  970511 o added t/05* to Parse::ePerl
           and made delimiter case variable
  970513 o enhanced Parse::ePerl and 
           finished Apache::ePerl
  970515 o fixed tests 4 and 5 for non-Bash users
           and fixed a char/int problem in eperl_main.c
           and eperl_sys.c
           [Thanks to Jarom Smith <jarom@jarom-indy.prophet.com>]
  970516 o finished Apache::ePerl and Parse::ePerl
  970517 o added a INSTALL.APACHE which describes the
           installation of ePerl as an SSSL under Apache

  Changes between 2.2a1 and 2.2a2
  -------------------------------

  970504 o removed -s and added -m 755 
           to install in configure
         o optimized the parser; no 
           ``print "";'' constructs are
           never created which at least slightly 
           speeds up processing.

  Changes between 2.2a0 and 2.2a1
  -------------------------------

  970503 o now the begin and end delimiters are searched
           case-insensitive.
         o added -h for displaying the usage list.
           Just to be consequent with options.
         o added leading and trailing whitespaces
           for Perl blocks when translating the source file
           to make the -x display more readable.

  Changes between 2.1.1 and 2.2a0
  -------------------------------

  970502 o added support for '=' prefix: now <:= ... :>
           automatically gets converted to "print ...".  Now one
           can interpolate variables in a more shorter way via
           <?=$variable!> instead of the long <?  print
           $variable; !> (in conjunction with the next
           enhancements)
         o now ePerl is much smarter when converting the ePerl
           blocks, i.e. it now recognizes final semicolons and
           automatically puts one if missing. Now <: cmd;cmd :>
           is also valid.
         o Whitespaces are not only stripped
           from the beginning of a ePerl block. Now
           they are stripped from the end, too.
         o !!CHANGED THE PARSING AGAIN!!
           Now again (as in 2.0.3) ePerl block end delimiters are
           found via plain forward search. No quoted strings are
           recognized.  The reason is that constructs with odd
           number of quoting characters are more often seen than
           end delimiters in quoted string. And one more fact: It
           is easier to escape the end delimiter in a quotes
           string (e.g.  via backslahes) than to rewrite a
           complex construct (e.g.  m|"[^"]+"| !!).
         o added -T (Tainting) and -w (Warnings) options
           which can be used like the same in "perl".
         o added alpha and snap releases to NEWVERS
