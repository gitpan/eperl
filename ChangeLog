  Changes in 2.0.0
  ================

  960102 o ePerl now supports the Perl 5 DynaLoader interface for
           dynamic linking and loading of shared modules. This provides ePerl
           with the complete power of the underlying Perl 5 installation,
           including the shared objects.

         o ePerl now runs as NPH-CGI/1.0 script, i.e. as a Non-Parsed-Header
           CGI-script. This means that it is able to create its own HTTP
           header.  Implications of this include:
             - To create HTTP headers just put them on the first
               lines in your script as plain text or just generate them on the
               fly by a ePerl block at the beginning of your script. With this
               feature you can for instance write pages which create images
               instead of HTML code.
             - If no headers were created by the script, it
               outputs it with MIME-type "text/html", including an additional
               calculated "Content-Length" header.
             - It automatically adds "Date" and "Server" headers.
  
         o ePerl now saves and checks the STDERR output of the script.
           If this contains data this implies an error and leads to the
           display of the error HTML page, displaying the STDERR output.
  
         o ePerl now saves the STDOUT output of the script (the real
           contents). This implies that it can calculate the Content-Length or
           ignore it if STDERR was created and the error page have to be
           displayed.
  
         o Additional environment variables will be set by ePerl
           prior to the execution of the bristled Perl blocks:
             SCRIPT_SRC_SIZE ....... the byte size of the original source file
             SCRIPT_SRC_MTIME ...... the integer value of the last modify time
             SCRIPT_SRC_MTIME_FMT .. the formatted string of the last modify time
             SCRIPT_SRC_OWNER ...... the owner of the original source file
             VERSION_INTERPRETER ... the ePerl version string
             VERSION_LANGUAGE ...... the Perl version string
  
         o The ePerl sources were split into distinct peaces to
           allow further development, e.g. a standalone program or a Apache
           API module.

  Changes in 1.5
  ==============

  9609xx o started with the work to split the ePerl
           functionality into a library and create a stand-alone
           CGI-program and a Apache module which use this library.

  Changes in 1.4
  ==============

  960906 o changed source from PATH_INFO to PATH_TRANSLATED

         o cleanup the sources and released it
           the first time officially on the Web

  Changes in 1.3
  ==============

  960622 o created WWW pages

         o changed all old EPL references to ePerl

         o added a lot of comments to the source

         o made the begin and end delimiters variable

         o changed the end delimiter from ">" to "!>"
           because ">" makes problems if it occurs inside the 
           ePerl block

  Changes in 1.2
  ==============

  960510 o created GNU autoconf files, Makefiles, etc.

  Changes in 1.1
  ==============

  960415 o fixed a bug in the escape code: more chars 
           have to be escaped!

  Changes in 1.0
  ==============

  960323 o works fine with Apache 1.1b0+ak

  960310 o *GENESIS*
