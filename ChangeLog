  ChangeLog of ePerl
  ==================

  v1.0  960310 *GENESIS* 

        960323 - works fine with Apache 1.1b0+ak

  v1.1  960415 - fixed a bug in the escape code: more chars 
                 have to be escaped!

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  v1.3  960622 - created WWW pages
               - changed all old EPL references to ePerl
               - added a lot of comments to the source
               - made the begin and end delimiters variable
               - changed the end delimiter from ">" to "!>"
                 because ">" makes problems if it occurs inside the 
                 ePerl block
