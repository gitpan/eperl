  ePerl -- Embedded Perl 5 Language

  Version 2.1b0 (22-03-1997)

  ePerl interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements by
  evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII data. It
  can operate both as a standard Unix filter for file generation and as a
  Webserver scripting language for dynamic HTML page programming.
