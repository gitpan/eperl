  =======================

  1. Requirements
     
     Make sure you have Perl 5.004 or at least 5.003 compiled with -DEMBED
     already installed on your system. The ``perl'' program should be in your
     path. If you have different Perl binaries in your path the one with the
     latest version number will be used.  Additionally you need a real ANSI C
     compiler like GCC to compile ePerl.

  2. Configuring the source

     The ePerl distribution is a hybrid source tree. It can be used to either
     install the stand-alone program "eperl" or the Perl 5 interface module
     "Parse::ePerl". Decide which one you want:

     a) Configure the ePerl source for building the stand-alone program:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/eperl/root 
                     [--with-perl=/path/of/preferred/perl]

     b) Configure the ePerl source for building the Perl 5 interface modules:
        $ perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=/path/to/private/area/]

  3. Run the build process

     Now you are ready to run the build process. Start it with a simple
     $ make

  4. Run the Test suite

     Optionally you can now run a test suite which will check if
     the programs work correctly before they get finally installed.
     $ make test

  5. Installation
     
     Finally install it into /path/to/eperl/root/{bin,man}/ (in case of the
     stand-alone program) or /path/to/private/area/lib/{Parse,Apache}/ (in
     case of the Perl 5 interface modules):
     $ make install

  6. Cleanup

     Now cleanup the source tree to make it vanilla again.
     $ make distclean
