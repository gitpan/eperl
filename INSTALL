  OVERVIEW FOR THE IMPATIENT
  ==========================

  To install the stand-alone program into /path/to/eperl/root/{bin,man}/:
      
      $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/eperl/root
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

  To install the integrated Perl 5 modules into

    a) your existing Perl system under 
       /path/to/existing/perl/area/lib/site_perl/{Parse,Apache}/:

      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

    b) a private area of your own under
       /path/to/your/perl/area/lib/site_perl/{Parse,Apache}/:

      $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/private/perl/area/
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install


  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  ====================

  1. Requirements
     ============
     
     Make sure you have a up-to-date release of Perl already installed on your
     system. Perl 5.004 is highly recommended to make use of the complete
     ePerl functionality.  Previous releases are only supported partially: for
     the stand-alone program you need at least Perl 5.003 compiled with
     -DEMBED while for the Perl 5 interface modules you need at least Perl
     5.003_90. Also make sure (``perl -V | grep sfio'')that your
     Perl-Interpreter doesn't use PerlIO in combination with SfIO, because
     this currently is not supported by ePerl.

     As a summary the following table shows the details of support grade:

         Perl               stand-alone        Perl 5
         version            ePerl program      interface modules
         ------------------ ------------------ -----------------
         5.003              no                 no
         5.003+-DEMBED      yes (minimum)      no
         5.003_01-5.003_25  yes (minimum)      no
         5.003_25-5.003_99  yes                yes
         5.004-...          yes                yes
     
  2. Configuring the source
     ======================

     The ePerl distribution is a hybrid source tree. It can be used to either
     install the stand-alone program "eperl" or the Perl 5 interface modules
     "Parse::ePerl" and "Apache::ePerl". Decide which one you want or just
     install both.

     First make sure that the ``perl'' program is in your path, so
     ``configure'' can find it. If you have different Perl binaries in your
     path the one with the latest version number will be used. If you want to
     force ePerl to be build with a specific Perl on your system (if you have
     more then one installed), you can also use option
     ``--with-perl=/path/to/bin/perl'' with ``configure'' or specify this
     specific one when running "Makefile.PL". 
     
     Additionally you need a real ANSI C compiler like GCC to compile ePerl,
     but most of the vendor compilers also work. Per default the C compiler is
     used which was used for compiling your Perl itself.  To overwrite this
     use ``CC=/path/to/bin/cc''.

     Now do _ONLY ONE_ of these steps:

     a) Configure the ePerl source via standard GNU conding style procedure
        for building the stand-alone program:

        $ [CC=/path/to/bin/cc] ./configure --prefix=/path/to/eperl/root 
                                           [--with-perl=/path/to/bin/perl]

     b) Configure the ePerl sources via standard MakeMaker procedure 
        for building the Perl 5 interface modules:

        $ [/path/to/bin/]perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=/path/to/private/perl/area/]
                                          [CC=/path/to/bin/cc]

  3. Build the object files
     ======================

     Now you are ready to run the build process. Start it with a simple
     ``Make'' call:

        $ make

  4. Run the Test suite
     ==================

     You can now run a test suite which will check if the programs work
     correctly before they get finally installed. I highly recommend you to do
     this step, even it is optional and not really required.
     
        $ make test

  5. Installation
     ============
     
     Finally install ePerl into /path/to/eperl/root/{bin,man}/ 
     (in case of the stand-alone program) or
     /path/to/private/perl/area/lib/site_perl/{Parse,Apache}/ 
     (in case of the Perl 5 interface modules). 
     _NO_ third-party files are changed on your system.

        $ make install

  6. Cleanup
     =======

     Now cleanup the source tree to make it a vanilla distribution again.

        $ make distclean
