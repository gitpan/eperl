  =======================

  1. Requirements
     
     Make sure you have a up-to-date release of Perl already installed on your
     system. Perl 5.004 is highly recommended to make use of the complete
     ePerl functionality.  Previous releases are only supported partially: for
     the stand-alone program you need at least Perl 5.003 compiled with
     -DEMBED while for the Perl 5 interface modules you need at least Perl
     5.003_90.

     As a summary the following table shows the details of support grade:

         Perl               stand-alone        Perl 5
         version            ePerl program      interface modules
         ------------------ ------------------ -----------------
         5.003              no                 no
         5.003+-DEMBED      yes (minimum)      no
         5.003_01-5.003_90  yes (minimum)      no
         5.003_90-5.003_99  yes                yes
         5.004-...          yes                yes
     
     Make sure that the ``perl'' program is in your path, so ``configure'' can
     find it. If you have different Perl binaries in your path the one with
     the latest version number will be used. If you want to force ePerl to be
     build with a specific Perl on your system (if you have more then one
     installed), you can also use option ``--with-perl'' with ``configure''.
     Additionally you need a real ANSI C compiler like GCC to compile ePerl,
     but most of the vendor compilers also work.

  2. Configuring the source

     The ePerl distribution is a hybrid source tree. It can be used to either
     install the stand-alone program "eperl" or the Perl 5 interface module
     "Parse::ePerl". Decide which one you want:

     a) Configure the ePerl source for building the stand-alone program:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/eperl/root 
                     [--with-perl=/path/of/preferred/perl]

     b) Configure the ePerl source for building the Perl 5 interface modules:
        $ perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=/path/to/private/area/]

  3. Run the build process

     Now you are ready to run the build process. Start it with a simple
     $ make

  4. Run the Test suite

     Optionally you can now run a test suite which will check if
     the programs work correctly before they get finally installed.
     $ make test

  5. Installation
     
     Finally install it into /path/to/eperl/root/{bin,man}/ (in case of the
     stand-alone program) or /path/to/private/area/lib/{Parse,Apache}/ (in
     case of the Perl 5 interface modules):
     $ make install

  6. Cleanup

     Now cleanup the source tree to make it vanilla again.
     $ make distclean
