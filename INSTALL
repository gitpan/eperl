  1. Make sure you have Perl 5.003 (compiled with -DEMBED) or higher (5.003_XX
     is ok, too) already installed on your system. The perl program should be
     in your path. If you have different perl binaries in your path the
     program with the latest version number will be used.  Additionally you
     need a real ANSI C compiler like GCC to compile ePerl.

  2. Configure the ePerl sources for compilation
  
     $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/eperl/root 
                  [--with-perl=/path/to/preferred/perl]

  3. Compile the ePerl interpreter

     $ make

  4. Optionally you can run a test suite now

     $ make test

  5. Finally install it into /path/to/eperl/root/{bin,man}/
   
     $ make install

  6. Aditionally install it into your HTTP Server
  
     $ cp eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl

     When you also want UID/GID-switching, you have to set the setuid bit:

     $ chown root /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl
     $ chmod u+s  /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl
     
     Finally configure your webserver to process all pages with extension
     '.phtml' via the ePerl NPH-CGI/1.1 program. For an Apache webserver add
     the following to your httpd.conf file:

     AddType      application/x-httpd-eperl  .phtml .eperl .epl
     Action       application/x-httpd-eperl  /internal/cgi/nph-eperl
     ScriptAlias  /internal/cgi              /path/to/apache/cgi-bin
