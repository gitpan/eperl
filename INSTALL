  1. Make sure you have Perl 5.003 or higher already
	 installed on your system. The perl program should be in your path. If you
	 have different perl binaries in your path the program with the latest
	 version number will be used.

  2. Compile the ePerl interpreter
  
     $ ./configure
     $ make

  3. Install it into your HTTP Server
  
     $ cp nph-eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/
     
  4. Configure your webserver to process all pages with extension '.phtml' via
     the ePerl NPH-CGI/1.0 program. For an Apache webserver add the following
     to your httpd.conf file:

     AddType      application/x-httpd-eperl  .phtml .eperl .epl
     Action       application/x-httpd-eperl  /internal/cgi/nph-eperl
     ScriptAlias  /internal/cgi              /path/to/apache/cgi-bin
