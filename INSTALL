INSTALLATION
============

1. Make sure you have Perl 5.002 or higher already
   installed on your system. The perl program should be in your path. If you
   have different perl binaries in your path the program with the latest
   version number will be used.

2. Compile the ePerl interpreter

   $ ./configure
   $ make

3. Install it into your HTTP Server. For Apache 1.1.1 the following will
   work:

   ScriptAlias  /internal/cgi              /sw/lib/apache/cgi-bin
   AddType      application/x-httpd-eperl  phtml eperl epl
   Action       application/x-httpd-eperl  /internal/cgi/user/eperl
