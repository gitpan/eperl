  Known Bugs in ePerl
  ===================

  o  When using

     - ePerl as a server-side scripting language
     - running under Apache 1.2
     - on a FreeBSD 2.1.5 system
     - ** with SetUID root enabled **

     then it hangs on any `cmd` or system("cmd") commands.

     => Observation: When removing the SetUID bit on 
                     nph-eperl all works fine.

     THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE SETUID BIT
     IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WAY THE PERL LIBRARY IMPLEMENTS
     THE SHELL ENTRY. I was unable to find the bug inside
     ePerl. Instead I think it is outside ePerl....
